# node-htmlindex
A simple HTML index for your directories. Best used with a reverse proxy setup.

## Installing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuyu0/node-htmlindex.git
npm install
cp config.sample.json config.json
```
Afterwards, edit the config to suit your needs and alternatively use something like [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) to daemonize the whole thing.
